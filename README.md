# SDOF-strain-rate

A nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom model incorporating strain rate effects is developed in this study to determine the dynamic progressive collapse responses of steel and reinforced concrete (RC) structures, utilizing the dynamic increase factor (DIF)-strain rate model while encompassing both the structural static and dynamic resistance.
